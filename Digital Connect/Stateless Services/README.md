> Note: This Postman collection was created to showcase Sabre DC Stateless Services and provide developers the ability to test them freely. Sabre APIs Test credentials are required to successfully test these services, if you are an existing Sabre APIs customer and do not have your CERT credentials, please contact your Sabre account manager.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To get the collection up and running:

* Please download the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) app
* Request for your [Sabre APIs CERT- environment credentials](https://developer.sabre.com/resources/getting_started_with_sabre_apis/)

### Setup and Build

Here are one-time steps for getting your test environment set up:

1. Run the Postman app on your local development machine 
2. Import the [environment file](https://github.com/SabreDevStudio/postman-collections/blob/master/Digital%20Connect/Stateless%20Services/beta/DC_Stateless-DefaultEnv.postman_environment.json) into Postman using the File -> Import option
3. Import the [latest collection file](https://github.com/SabreDevStudio/postman-collections/blob/master/Digital%20Connect/Stateless%20Services/beta/DC_Stateless_Services_Beta.postman_collection.json) into Postman using the File -> Import option
4. Add your credentials and airline information to the environment file. This file has a list of key/value pairs. The following variables needs to be populated with your airline information: 
    * `organization`
    * `domain`
    * `posCountry`
    * `posOfficeCode`
    * `posAccountingCity`
    * `posStation`
    * `lniata`
    * `pcc`
    * `secret`: The 'secret' variable needs to b e populated with you base64-encoded string that you got after checking instructions in [Sabre APIs CERT- environment credentials](https://developer.sabre.com/resources/getting_started_with_sabre_apis/)
 
Steps to update the values with your official credentials:
  1. Click the gear icon to go to the manage environments pop-up dialog box.
  2. Click on the name of your imported environment file to see a list of all key/value pairs.
  3. Enter your credentials, and press the "Update" button.    

## Running the Tests

Simply open one of the folders, go to "Display PNR" request in the folder, then in "Pre-request Script" area update PNR infromation and finally click the **Send** button - look for a 200 Success result. After that you can proceed e execute subsequent requests in the folder.

You can use the Runner for any of the folders under `Sample Use Cases` folder in the collection.

1.	Make sure that you go to "Display PNR" request in the specific use case folder, then in "Pre-request Script" tab update PNR information and save request.
